The project explored different data structures for managing course information, specifically vectors, hash tables, and trees. Each structure was evaluated for its pros and cons in handling course data, such as simplicity and efficiency in access (vector), fast lookup times (hash table), and natural order maintenance with efficient insertion and search (tree). The project involved creating functions for loading courses from files into these structures, printing course details or all courses, and addressing specific challenges like sorting and maintaining balance in trees. This hands-on experience emphasized the importance of choosing the right data structure based on the application's requirements for performance and data organization, enhancing the ability to design more maintainable, readable, and adaptable software.
